## Overview
NosUI is a plus-ui fork maintained by NATIVEVML.

NosUI (Native OS UI) is a jQuery library that helps to create useful, extensible and easily stylable browser components. The idea is to have the custom component functionality work as closely to native the component functionality as possible. With JavaScript disabled the default component functionality will still work without a problem.

**View component [example page](http://jamygolden.github.io/plus-ui/)**.
## Features
* [BEM](http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/) friendly
* SCSS used. Easy to customize components.
* Simple and extensible API
* NosUI works ontop of default browser components therefore if JS is disabled the default components still function correctly.
* Plays well with others. State changes to the custom form element are mirrored on the actual form elements themselves.
* IE7+ Support
